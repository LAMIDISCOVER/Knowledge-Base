   unsupervised model:
   
   study without a clear problem/ question 
   gather data first 
   using cluster to observe the data pattern and correlation 
   then identify the problem 
   
   notes :
model accuracy 
if you have a model that is 99% accuracy in training  and 70% accuracy in testing 
training > testing : This is how we know its NOT overfitting
