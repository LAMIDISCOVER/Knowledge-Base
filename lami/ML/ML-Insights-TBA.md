machine learning is more like an art than science ： not every business problem is a machine learning problem 
- if you dont have a good solution to your problem, it maybe because you dont have a good question 
- you need to have the confidence to know and accept that your model is wrong.

**Accuracy** ： 
- when different models have similar accuracy : 97% 96% 99%
what does it tell you ?
- result is too good to be true - MODEL IS WRONG 
- problem is too simple to be solved - WRONG PROBLEM 
reality :
- 70%-80% accuracy should be a good model for ML

limitation of dataset 
- tenpo gap between lab and testing 
- when we build data set : 
  - we leave the gap in the action time 
  - 4 months -6 monyhs time
