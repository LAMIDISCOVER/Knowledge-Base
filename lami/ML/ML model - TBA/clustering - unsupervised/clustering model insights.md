   **Unsupervised Model:**
	   study without a clear problem/ question 
	   gather data first 
	   using cluster to observe the data pattern and correlation 
	   then identify the problem 
   

**Model Accuracy**  
	if you have a model that is 99% accuracy in training  and 70% accuracy in testing 
	training > testing : This is how we know its NOT overfitting
